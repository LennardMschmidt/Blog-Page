# Blog-Page

I created a Blog Page using ejs. this works only on a local server using NPM.
With the help of EJS, Javascript and HTML I created a project where it is possible to upload blog posts and reach them through an indivual url when the blog post is clicked.
Using EJS I was happy to find out a new way of putting HTML and Javascript together.
